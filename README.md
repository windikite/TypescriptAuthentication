My 54th assignment! In this we learn to authenticate, protect routes and store/use JWT tokens.  

I created a component called SessionStorageManager and implemented functions to securely save to and retrieve JWT tokens from session storage. The LogIn component starts the process of logging in, and when the api call returns an appropriate token will save the token using a custom hook. From there, it is stored within the sessionStorage and the application's context. 

If the api could provide user information based on that token it would be easy to navigate to a userProfile component and render the profile information. I had originally attempted to do just that, but as the solution would have involved storing the username on login, fetching all users, and comparing the usernames to find the ID to fetch the profile information, I felt it was too hacky of a solution when it wasn't even necessary here.  

I did integrate the session manager and log in components into a full application along with a log out component and a dashboard. The dashboard's route is protected, so as long as the user is authenticated they can reach there and see their token. If the user is not authenticated, they will be redirected back to the login page.
